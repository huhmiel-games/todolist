# TODO APP

## frontend

Todolist in React with react-router.
The online version on github pages works without the backend. It uses a mockedApi with localStorage (no http requests :/).

## backend

Very simple node express backend to starts the project. I choose SQLite for the simplicity of setup.

## Testing

The frontend and backend are covered by unit tests with Jest

## AngularTodo

Discovery of Angular with no mocked backend. I will work now on tests and backend mock...
