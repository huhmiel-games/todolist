# TODO APP

## frontend

The online version on github pages works without the backend. It uses a mocked api with localStorage (no http requests :/).

## backend

Very simple node express backend to starts the project. I choose SQLite for the simplicity of setup.

## Testing

The frontend and backend are covered by unit tests with Jest
